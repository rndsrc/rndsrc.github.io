[Chi-kwan Chan (CK)](https://rndsrc.dev/)
is an
[Associate Astronomer/Research Professor](https://www.as.arizona.edu/people/faculty/chi-kwan-chan)
at Steward Observatory and the Department of Astronomy, University of
Arizona, and has been serving as the
[Secretary](https://eventhorizontelescope.org/organization)
of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) Science Council since 2020.
He recently led the
[publication](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...930L..16A/abstract)
of the computational and theoretical modeling/interpretation of our
black hole, Sgr A*.
Dr. Chan created EHT's computational and data processing
infrastructure and continues to lead it to this day, along with EHT's
Software and Data Compatibility Working Group.
He is a Senior Investigator of
[Black Hole PIRE](https://bhpire.arizona.edu/),
a leader of the Theoretical Astrophysics Program
[TAP](https://tap.arizona.edu/working-groups/),
a Data Science Fellow, and a member of the Applied Mathematics
Program.
In addition to pioneering the use of GPU to accelerate the
[modeling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSqvoy2I6SE)
of black holes, Dr. Chan also developed many new
[algorithms](https://github.com/rndsrc)
to improve and accelerate modern research, built
[cloud computing infrastructures](https://edu.google.com/why-google/customer-stories/eht-gcp/)
for large observational data, and applied machine learning algorithms
to speed up and automate data processing.
Dr. Chan has taught and mentored in subjects of machine
learning, numerical analysis, cloud computing, and quantum computing,
and is an avid hiker.
